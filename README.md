# Crypto Dashboard and Crypto Tracker

This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is it ?

This is a simple front-end project divided in two app, the first one is a simple Crypto Converter using two api's from [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/) :

- [Alpha Vantage](https://rapidapi.com/alphavantage/api/alpha-vantage/) : Used to get exchange values of a given Crypto or real Currency
- [Crypto news Live](https://rapidapi.com/DIlyanBarbov/api/crypto-news-live/) : Used to create a feed of the 10 most recent Crypto related news

And the Second one is a Tracker of 100 CryptoCurrencies using [Coin gecko Api](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation)
